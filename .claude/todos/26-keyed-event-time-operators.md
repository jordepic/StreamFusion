# Keyed / event-time operators unlocked by columnar watermarks + shuffle

**Status:** open (roadmap) — infrastructure landed, operators not yet built.
**Source:** what the columnar watermark assigner (ticket = done) + columnar keyed
shuffle (ticket 10) + the generic window core unlocked.

## Why these are newly feasible
The columnar keyed exchange (carry Arrow across a `keyBy`, co-locating keys with
watermark propagation) + the columnar watermark assigner (event-time in the
columnar world) + `NativeWindowOperatorCore<OUT>` (a stateful op can emit Arrow
partials) together form the backbone for the whole **keyed + event-time +
append-only** operator family. Each below reuses the exact pipeline shape we
already run for windows: `columnar source → watermark assigner → columnar keyed
exchange → columnar keyed operator`.

Each line becomes its own ticket when picked up; parity-gated per the usual
discipline (matcher admits only what we reproduce exactly; verified against the
host by `NativeParity`).

## Directly unlocked — single-input, drop straight into the existing shape
- [~] **Event-time `OVER` aggregation** — DONE, **columnar**, for the default
      `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` frame, with or without
      `PARTITION BY` (bigint/int/string keys), SUM/MIN/MAX/COUNT/AVG over one
      bigint/int/double value column. The native `OverWindowAggregator` buffers input
      batches and, on a watermark, emits the completed rows with the running
      aggregate appended — input columns pass through, so it rides the columnar
      shuffle with no transpose (native source → wm assigner → columnar exchange →
      columnar OVER, parity-tested incl. partitioned over a Parquet source). AVG
      works via Flink's `$SUM0`+`COUNT` decomposition (divide on the host). The
      `$SUM0` = SUM mapping holds because an OVER frame is never empty.
      **Follow-ups:** bounded frames / `ROWS` (needs frame eviction), proctime.
- [ ] **Append-only deduplication** — keep-*first*-row
      (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY k ORDER BY rt) = 1`). Keyed, insert-only.
      (Keep-*last* is retracting — blocked on ticket 06.)
- [ ] **Window Top-N** and **window deduplication** — built on the windowing-TVF +
      keyed-shuffle infra we now have; append-only.
- [ ] **Event-time sort** (`ORDER BY rt`) — watermark-driven, ~no shuffle;
      unlocked by the watermark assigner alone.

## Partially unlocked — need one more piece: a columnar **two-input** operator
Every operator we have is one-input. Joins need a two-input columnar operator
(two `ColumnarInput` edges; connected watermark = min of both inputs). Build that
first, then:
- [ ] **Window join** (append-only, windowing-TVF based).
- [ ] **Interval join** (`a.rt BETWEEN b.rt - X AND b.rt + Y`) — keyed shuffle on
      the join key + watermark-bounded state cleanup. (Ticket 11: interval/instant
      join.)

## Still blocked regardless — by the insert-only constraint, not by the shuffle
These emit retracting/updating changelogs; they need [ticket 06](06-changelog-retract-support.md)
(changelog/`RowKind` support — the long-term move away from append-only), not the
shuffle work:
- Non-windowed `GROUP BY` aggregation, regular (non-windowed) joins, streaming
  Top-N, keep-last deduplication, temporal joins.
