# Roadmap / backlog index

Read this first. It is the ordered map of what is done and what remains; each item points to a
detailed ticket. Keep it in step as tickets are completed or added; delete a ticket's pointer
here when the ticket is deleted.

## Where we are (done + parity-verified)
- **Operators, native + identical to Flink:** filter/`WHERE` (via the native expression engine),
  tumbling / hopping / session / cumulative window aggregates (one- and two-phase), Parquet sink
  (exactly-once), Parquet source. Compatibility chart in `readme.md` is the source of truth.
- **Columnar-flow mechanism (ticket 21):** `ArrowBatch` stream type + IPC serializer, the two
  transpose operators, the transition-inserter pass, `ColumnarInput`/`ColumnarOutput` markers.
  **Columnar today:** filter (in+out), Parquet sink (in), Parquet source (out). **Not yet
  columnar:** the window operators (gated on the shuffle — see below).
- **Profiling/benchmarks (ticket 20):** Criterion native micro-benches; `ThroughputBenchmark`
  vs Flink; the `bench` Maven profile (release native — mandatory for benchmarks).
- **Release benchmarks vs Flink:** Parquet copy (columnar→columnar) 3.19×, tumbling 1.21×,
  Parquet sink (row source) 1.05×, bare filter 0.83×.

## Next, roughly in order
1. **Columnar shuffle — Arrow across the keyBy/exchange** (ticket 10). **Mechanism DONE** (native
   by-key split + `SplitByKeyGroupOperator` + `ColumnarKeyGroupPartitioner`, tested). The hash is a
   plain consistent hash (no Flink-hash reproduction needed — it only distributes work; the keyed
   consumer is our own native operator). **Remaining: planner integration** — replace a keyed
   `StreamExecExchange` with the columnar exchange, coupled to converting the downstream window to
   `ColumnarInput` (item 2). That end-to-end step lights up columnar windows + columnar two-phase.
2. **Columnar windows** (ticket 21, gated on #1). Convert the window operators to `Arrow → Arrow`
   + mark `ColumnarInput`/`ColumnarOutput`, so a filter→window chain and the windowed input edge
   stay columnar. Blocked on #1 because windows sit downstream of a keyBy.
3. **Parquet sink file coalescing** (ticket 22). The sink writes one file per batch; buffer and
   roll by size/row-count so output file count is independent of read-batch size. Independent of
   the shuffle; improves output quality and throughput.
4. **Expression layer stages 2–3** (ticket 19): general/computed projection (unblocks the
   constant-folded `=` filter), fuse projection+filter, widen the op set; plus the residual
   narrow-int (`TINYINT`/`SMALLINT`) arithmetic-overflow parity check.
5. **Wider value/key types** (ticket 04): SMALLINT/TINYINT/FLOAT `SUM`/`AVG`, DECIMAL/TIMESTAMP
   grouping keys, multiple value columns, `COUNT(*)`.
6. **Richer columnar endpoints** (ticket 24): beyond local Parquet — Iceberg and remote
   filesystems (`hdfs:`/`s3:`) for the native source/sink; currently `file:` only.
7. **Operator-level perf** (ticket 20 backlog): Java column-vectorized whole-row converter (the
   transpose is cell-at-a-time), per-row `GroupKey` allocation in aggregators, session `update`
   one-row `take` batching.
8. **Acceleration policy** (ticket 09): now that lone stateless islands measure < 1× (bare filter
   0.83×), decide whether to refuse substituting an operator that would be an isolated island with
   row endpoints on both sides, vs always substitute. Benchmark-informed.

## Production-readiness (not yet load-bearing)
- **Memory accounting** (ticket 05): native `RootAllocator`s per operator are not accounted
  against Flink's `MemoryManager`.
- **Mailbox threading** (ticket 01): native execution should integrate with the task mailbox
  (non-blocking), not block the task thread.
- **Changelog / retract** (ticket 06): only insert-only streams are native today.

## Breadth / longer horizon
- **Two-phase cumulative windows** (ticket 13).
- **Arroyo operator coverage tracker** (ticket 11): joins, OVER/window functions, non-windowed
  GROUP BY, etc.
- **Fully native Kafka source, no JNI** (back burner, noted in ticket 21): subscribe in Rust,
  decode Avro→Arrow, only if the connector semantics can be lifted from Arroyo.
