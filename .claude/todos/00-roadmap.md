# Roadmap / backlog index

Read this first. It is the ordered map of what is done and what remains; each item points to a
detailed ticket. Keep it in step as tickets are completed or added; delete a ticket's pointer
here when the ticket is deleted.

## Where we are (done + parity-verified)
- **Operators, native + identical to Flink:** filter/`WHERE` (via the native expression engine),
  tumbling / hopping / session / cumulative window aggregates (one- and two-phase), event-time
  `OVER` aggregation, event-time INNER interval and window joins, Parquet sink (exactly-once),
  Parquet source. Compatibility chart in `readme.md` is the source of truth.
- **Columnar flow, end to end (tickets 10, 21):** `ArrowBatch` stream type + IPC serializer, the two
  transpose operators, the transition-inserter pass, `ColumnarInput`/`ColumnarOutput` markers, a
  **columnar watermark assigner**, and a **columnar keyed shuffle** (native by-key split +
  `ColumnarKeyGroupPartitioner`, own consistent hash — divergences/10). Columnar today: source, sink,
  filter/calc, all window aggregates (one- and two-phase), `OVER`, and both joins — a windowed/keyed
  pipeline (source → watermark assigner → exchange → operator) flows Arrow with no transpose.
- **Joins delegate the match to DataFusion** (`HashJoinExec` over the batches we buffer), like
  Arroyo; we own buffering + watermark eviction (tickets 26, 27).
- **Profiling/benchmarks (ticket 20):** Criterion native micro-benches; `ThroughputBenchmark`
  vs Flink; the `bench` Maven profile (release native — mandatory for benchmarks).
- **Release benchmarks vs Flink (clean):** Parquet copy 2.61×, windowed-over-columnar 1.82×,
  interval join 1.71×, OVER 1.56×, tumbling 1.24×, Parquet sink 1.06×, bare filter 0.75×. After the
  row-major + pre-sized transpose build (ticket 28) only the lone stateless filter stays below 1×
  (its `RowData → Arrow → RowData` round-trip; ticket 21).

## Next, roughly in order
1. **Parquet sink file coalescing** (ticket 22). The sink writes one file per batch; buffer and
   roll by size/row-count so output file count is independent of read-batch size. Independent of
   the shuffle; improves output quality and throughput.
2. **Expression layer stages 2–3** (ticket 19): general/computed projection (unblocks the
   constant-folded `=` filter), fuse projection+filter, widen the op set; plus the residual
   narrow-int (`TINYINT`/`SMALLINT`) arithmetic-overflow parity check.
3. **Wider value/key types** (ticket 04): SMALLINT/TINYINT/FLOAT `SUM`/`AVG`, DECIMAL/TIMESTAMP
   grouping keys, multiple value columns, `COUNT(*)`.
4. **Richer columnar endpoints** (ticket 24): beyond local Parquet — Iceberg and remote
   filesystems (`hdfs:`/`s3:`) for the native source/sink; currently `file:` only. **Deferred by
   direction until generalized operator support lands** — broaden what we can run (items 2–3 and the
   ticket 11 operators) before broadening where we read/write.
5. **Operator-level perf** (ticket 20 backlog): per-row `GroupKey` allocation in aggregators, session
   `update` one-row `take` batching. (The `RowData → Arrow` transpose was made row-major + pre-sized,
   ~25% faster — ticket 28; a native decoder was investigated and rejected on benchmark grounds.)
6. **Acceleration policy** (ticket 09): now that lone stateless islands measure < 1× (bare filter
   0.83×), decide whether to refuse substituting an operator that would be an isolated island with
   row endpoints on both sides, vs always substitute. Benchmark-informed.

## Production-readiness (not yet load-bearing)
- **Memory accounting** (ticket 05): native `RootAllocator`s per operator are not accounted
  against Flink's `MemoryManager`.
- **Mailbox threading** (ticket 01): native execution should integrate with the task mailbox
  (non-blocking), not block the task thread.
- **Changelog / retract** (ticket 06): only insert-only streams are native today.

## Breadth / longer horizon
- **Arroyo operator coverage tracker** (ticket 11): append-only dedup, window Top-N, event-time
  sort remain; non-windowed GROUP BY / regular joins / streaming Top-N need retract (ticket 06).
  (Two-phase cumulative windows and event-time joins are now done.)
- **Fully native Kafka source, no JNI** (back burner, noted in ticket 21): subscribe in Rust,
  decode Avro→Arrow, only if the connector semantics can be lifted from Arroyo.
