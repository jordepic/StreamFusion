/**
 * Arrow ↔ {@code RowData} conversion, vendored from Apache Flink's {@code flink-python} module
 * (package {@code org.apache.flink.table.runtime.arrow}, Apache-2.0). The per-type column vectors and
 * field writers are copied verbatim (only repackaged); {@link
 * io.github.jordepic.streamfusion.arrow.ArrowConversion} is a trimmed extract of {@code ArrowUtils}'s
 * schema/reader/writer factories, with timestamps pinned to nanoseconds to match the native side.
 *
 * <p>Vendored rather than depended on because the upstream classes live in {@code flink-python}, which a
 * standard Java Flink deployment ships under {@code opt/} (not on the runtime classpath). They depend
 * only on {@code flink-table-runtime}'s columnar interfaces and Arrow, both already on the classpath.
