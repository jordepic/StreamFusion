/**
 * One Arrow allocator shared by every native operator in this JVM for the buffers that cross the
 * native↔JVM C Data Interface, never closed during execution — the StreamFusion analog of
 * datafusion-comet's {@code CometArrowAllocator}.
 *
 * <p>Arrow Java buffers are reference-counted: an exported/imported batch keeps the underlying buffers
 * alive until its refcount reaches zero. A per-operator allocator closed at the operator's {@code
 * close()} is safe only while every consumer is synchronous (a chained {@code collect()} runs the
 * downstream to completion) or copied across the network; an async consumer that finishes after the
 * producer's allocator closes would make the allocator report a false leak (the failure a file
 * source's fetcher thread hit). Sharing one long-lived allocator removes that latent constraint, as
 * comet does for the same reason. Buffers are still reclaimed promptly by refcount as each batch's
 * vectors are closed downstream.
 *
 * <p>This is independent of memory accounting: limiting/attributing execution memory per operator is a
 * DataFusion memory-pool concern bridged to the framework's memory manager, not the allocator's scope.
