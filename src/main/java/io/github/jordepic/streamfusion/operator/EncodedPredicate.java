/**
 * A residual non-equi join predicate encoded in the pre-order form the native filter engine decodes
 * (the {@code RexExpression} arrays), carried to a native join operator. {@link #NONE} is the
 * empty predicate (no residual condition); the native side treats empty {@code kinds} as "no
 * predicate".
 *
 * <p>Carries a {@link NativeUdf.Binding} so a predicate that references a UDF (e.g. {@code UPPER} or a
 * user {@code ScalarFunction}) is distributed-safe: the operator calls {@link #bind} at {@code open()}
 * to register the UDFs on its own JVM and get the {@code longs} with runtime ids patched in, and
 * {@link #unbind} at {@code close()} — so a distributed task manager resolves them, not just the planner.
