/**
 * The full Nexmark matrix: every query StreamFusion currently accelerates end-to-end, each run against
 * stock Flink and against native execution from every source it can be fed by — the generator (rowwise
 * RowData), a local Parquet file (a columnar file source read straight to Arrow, no ingest transpose),
 * and Kafka json/avro/protobuf, the Kafka formats climbing the source→columnar ladder (JVM transpose,
 * Rust decode with a JVM poll, fully native Rust poll+decode). One table per query, a native cell per
 * source, each a speedup over the Flink baseline for that same source.
 *
 * <p>The Parquet source is the columnar-source case: the same wide event row is written once to a local
 * Parquet directory, then read back through the native {@code filesystem}/{@code parquet} scan — the
 * rows never become {@code RowData} at ingest, so a fully native pipeline pays only the sink transpose.
 * Its rowtime is a plain {@code TIMESTAMP(3)} (unlike the Kafka {@code TIMESTAMP_LTZ}), so the {@code
 * DATE_FORMAT}/{@code HOUR} queries that are generator-only on Kafka run here too.
 *
 * <p>The optional Fluss rung ({@code SF_MATRIX_FLUSS=true}) preloads the same wide event row into a
 * local Fluss test cluster, then reads it back through both Fluss's stock Flink connector and the
 * native fluss-rs log-table source. Both engines run the identical SQL (no limit) in the same
 * default streaming environment the other rungs use; because the Fluss log table is unbounded, each
 * run counts changelog rows in the sink and cancels the job once the Nth row arrives, reporting
 * time-to-Nth-row. N is the query's full output cardinality over the preloaded events, measured once
 * per query with stock Flink on the bounded generator (the same rows the preload wrote) through its
 * watermarked event-time views — the Fluss table declares the identical watermark, and a preloaded
 * far-future sentinel event closes the final windows the generator's end-of-input flush closes — so
 * both engines are cancelled at the same row. Queries with no such deterministic N report a skip
 * cell instead — see {@link #flussSkipReason}.
 *
 * <p>The query set is every query StreamFusion accelerates: q0–q5, q7–q23 (q1's and q14's decimal are
 * exact and native by default; q21's REGEXP_EXTRACT/LOWER and q14's HOUR route through the host
 * implementation via the columnar JVM upcall; q13 is a synchronous lookup join against a bounded
 * {@code test-lookup} dimension). Only q6 is out — Flink itself cannot run it (wontdos/39). q10/q14/q15/
 * q16/q17 report on the generator only, since their {@code DATE_FORMAT}/{@code HOUR} need a plain
 * {@code TIMESTAMP} and would partially fall back over the Kafka {@code TIMESTAMP_LTZ} rowtime.
 * Each query runs over the same logical {@code person}/{@code auction}/{@code bid} views the published
 * Nexmark SQL uses, off a watermarked event-time {@code dateTime}; the only thing that changes between
 * cells is how those rows are produced and transposed into the columnar island. The perimeter transposes
 * (source and sink) stay in the measured path — the steelman per CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * <p>Opt-in (millions of rows, Docker for Testcontainers Kafka, the {@code kafka} cargo feature for the
 * native source): {@code SF_BENCHMARK=true mvn test -Pbench -Dnative.cargo.args="build --release
 * --features kafka" -Dtest=NexmarkMatrixBenchmark}. {@code SF_ROWS} overrides the event count (default
 * 500,000), {@code SF_MATRIX_QUERIES} a comma-separated query subset (e.g. {@code q0,q7,q15}), {@code
 * SF_LADDER_FORMATS} the Kafka formats (default {@code json,avro,protobuf}), {@code SF_MATRIX_GENERATOR}
 * ({@code false} to skip the generator column), {@code SF_MATRIX_PARQUET} ({@code false} to skip the
 * Parquet column), {@code SF_MATRIX_KAFKA} ({@code false} to skip Kafka), {@code SF_MATRIX_FLUSS}
 * ({@code true} to include the first stock Flink-on-Fluss baseline).
