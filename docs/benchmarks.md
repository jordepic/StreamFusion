# Benchmarks

Acceleration claims in this project are measured, not asserted. This is where the
method and the numbers live.

## Native operator micro-benchmarks

[`native/benches/operators.rs`](../native/benches/operators.rs) measures each native
operator's steady-state hot loop over an in-memory Arrow batch, isolated from the JVM
bridge and from Flink's job scheduling (which otherwise dominates and hides operator
cost). Built on [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs).

Run:

```bash
cd native && cargo bench
```

Criterion reports time per batch with a confidence interval and compares against the
previous run, so a regression in a hot loop is visible commit-to-commit. Each bench
declares its row count as throughput, so Criterion also prints elements/s.

Current benches:
- `filter/gt_literal` — the compiled-predicate filter (`v > 0`) over a 4096-row batch,
  half passing. The predicate is compiled once before the loop, so this measures
  evaluation + the Arrow filter kernel, not planning.
- `tumbling/sum_update_flush` — a tumbling `SUM` over 16 windows: one `update` of a
  4096-row batch followed by a `flush` of all closed windows, from fresh state each
  iteration.
- `tumbling/sum_keyed_update_flush` — the same, grouped by a bigint key (64 distinct
  values), so it exercises the per-row grouping-key path the unkeyed bench does not.
  The `_accounted` variant attaches a managed-memory budget, measuring the per-touched-group
  footprint tracking an operator pays when the host hands it one (default off in the plain bench,
  so the unaccounted number is the like-for-like baseline).
- `session/sum_keyed_update_flush` — a session `SUM` grouped by key (gap merge). Its rows are
  spaced beyond the gap, so every row opens its own one-row session — the worst case for session
  state (4096 open sessions). `session/sum_keyed_dense_update_flush` is the complementary shape:
  each key's rows chain within the gap into one long session, the common real workload.
- `over/running_sum_keyed`, `over/row_number_keyed`, `over/bounded_rows_sum_keyed` — the columnar
  `OVER` push+flush, for a running `SUM` (specialized fold), `ROW_NUMBER` (per-key counter), and a
  bounded `ROWS 10 PRECEDING` frame (per-key buffer + frame recompute).
- `retract_topn/insert_top10_of_64` — the retracting Top-N (changelog input, full buffers):
  steady-state inserts into 64 pre-populated partitions, each paying the partition probe, ordered
  insert, and before/after top-10 diff.
- `dedup/keep_first_emitted_probe` — keep-first dedup in its steady state: all 256 keys already
  emitted, so each row is one emitted-set probe and a drop.
- `exchange/split_by_key_8` — the columnar shuffle's by-key split: hash each row's key to one of
  8 partitions and gather the sub-batches.
- `interval_join/equi_key_push`, `window_join/equi_key_flush` — the two joins with a unique key
  (1:1 match, no cross product), so they measure the DataFusion hash-join construction per batch.

### Results

Numbers are only comparable within a machine; record the host (CPU) alongside. The release
profile pins `codegen-units = 1` (see `native/Cargo.toml`): with the default parallel split,
hot-loop numbers swung ~50% from unrelated code additions elsewhere in the crate, so numbers
measured before the pin (or without it) are not comparable to these.

| `json_decode/three_field_object` | 4096 | 610 µs | ~6.7 Melem/s | ~46 B docs, simd-json tape walk |
| `json_decode/nexmark_bid_shape` | 4096 | 985 µs | ~4.2 Melem/s | ~210 B docs, 4 of 7 fields skipped |

The gap between filter and aggregation is the signal: the filter is a compiled
expression plus one Arrow kernel, while an aggregator groups every row by its key and
holds per-group accumulator state across batches.
Profiling-driven cuts so far (tumbling, 4096-row batch):

- reusing the per-row window buffer instead of allocating one per row (244 → 181 µs);
- moving the row's key into its last window instead of cloning it for every window
  (181 → 171 µs unkeyed, 395 → 323 µs keyed);
- a fast hash (`ahash`) for the grouping map instead of the stdlib SipHash
  (171 → ~106 µs unkeyed, 323 → ~252 µs keyed);
- one codegen unit for the release build (~106 → ~84 µs unkeyed; most operators gained
  10–17%, and the numbers stopped drifting with unrelated code churn);
- the joins stopped rebuilding a full DataFusion `SessionContext` (its entire function
  registry) per pushed batch — a bare `TaskContext` (or the operator's cached pool-wired
  one, when accounted) is all a hash join needs (interval join ~115 → ~63 µs, window join
  ~184 → ~130 µs at equal codegen settings);
- the Kafka JSON/CDC decode swapped arrow-json's scalar tokenizer for a simd-json (SIMD
  stage-1) parse walked straight into typed Arrow builders — ~8% on tiny 3-field documents,
  ~27% on a realistic Nexmark-bid-sized document (1.36 ms → 985 µs; decimal-bearing schemas
  keep the arrow-json raw-literal path for exactness — see `divergences/18`);
- the session aggregator stopped slicing the value column one row at a time: rows are grouped
  per key and segmented (in timestamp order) into gap-connected runs — the connected components
  the row-at-a-time walk would build — so a run pays one `take` + one accumulator update
  (2.04 ms → 217 µs, 9.4×, on the dense gap-chained shape; the one-row-session shape is
  per-session-bound and unchanged). The open-session merge scan also became a bounded
  `BTreeMap` range probe instead of a walk of every open session, which matters when a key
  holds many not-yet-closed sessions;
- the windowed aggregators (tumbling/hopping/cumulative and session) swapped their
  `Vec<ScalarValue>` group keys for the arrow-row memcomparable encoding the non-windowed
  GROUP BY already used: keys are encoded once per batch, the per-batch grouping map holds
  borrowed byte-row views (no per-row allocation), and flush decodes stored keys straight
  back into output columns (keyed tumbling 245 → 110 µs, 2.2×; dense session 217 → 101 µs;
  the managed-memory-accounted variant gained the same).

Net so far: the unkeyed tumbling path is ~3.2× faster (244 → ~77 µs) and the keyed path ~3.6×
(395 → ~110 µs). The 2026-07-05 round retired the remaining scalar-keyed loops onto the same
arrow-row byte state: the three keyed `OVER` loops (running sum 422 → 183 µs, ROW_NUMBER
342 → 131 µs, bounded frame 688 → 452 µs), the retracting Top-N (10.2 → 3.1 ms — byte sort keys
replace the scalar comparator, `Arc`-shared payloads make the per-row before/after snapshots
refcount bumps), keep-first dedup's emitted set (+6%), and the exchange split (174 → 57 µs,
hashing the encoded key bytes). The last scalar-keyed maps (window Top-N, changelog normalizer,
temporal join, mini-batch local aggregate) are bench-gated candidates on the [profiling
ticket](../.claude/todos/20-profiling-and-benchmarks.md).

The running `OVER` aggregate was the per-row outlier (~2.6 Melem/s, a DataFusion accumulator
`update_batch` + `evaluate` per row); replacing it with a specialized typed running fold —
matching the accumulators exactly (wrapping integer sum, null-skipping) but without the per-row
call — took it to ~8 Melem/s (3×), and the arrow-row key swap above to ~22 Melem/s. The session
aggregator's dense (gap-chained) shape runs at
tumbling-level throughput (~40 Melem/s); its sparse shape (~1.9 Melem/s, high-variance) is bound
by genuinely per-session costs — accumulator creation and flush materialization for 4096 one-row
sessions — not by the update loop.

## End to end vs. Flink

`ThroughputBenchmark` (opt-in: `SF_BENCHMARK=true mvn test -Pbench -Dtest=ThroughputBenchmark`)
runs the same query over a large generated source (5M rows; override with `SF_ROWS`) into a
sink, once with native substitution installed and once on stock Flink, single slot. It reports
best-of-3 rows/s for each and the native/Flink ratio. A warmup run absorbs JIT and minicluster
startup so the measured runs reflect execution.

**The `-Pbench` profile is mandatory** — it builds and loads the *release* native library.
Without it, `mvn test` uses the debug build (fast to compile, ~10–20× slower to run), which
makes every native number misleadingly low. (Measured: the columnar copy below ran 0.48× on
the debug build and 3.0× on release — same code.)

| Operator | Query | Flink | Native | Native vs. Flink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Parquet copy (columnar source → sink) | `INSERT INTO parquet SELECT * FROM parquet` | 1.35 M rows/s | 6.34 M rows/s | **4.68×** |
| Parquet sink (row source) | `INSERT INTO parquet SELECT *` | 1.23 M rows/s | 2.76 M rows/s | **2.24×** |
| Windowed aggregate over a columnar source | `SUM` by 1s window from a Parquet table | 1.80 M rows/s | 3.29 M rows/s | **1.82×** |
| Interval join (event-time) | `a JOIN b ON a.k=b.k AND a.rt BETWEEN b.rt ± 1s` | 0.37 M rows/s | 0.63 M rows/s | **1.71×** |
| `OVER` running `SUM` (row source) | `SUM(v) OVER (ORDER BY rt)` | 0.91 M rows/s | 1.42 M rows/s | **1.56×** |
| Tumbling (row source) | `SUM` by 1s window | 1.69 M rows/s | 2.10 M rows/s | **1.24×** |
| Filter (`WHERE`) | `SELECT * FROM f WHERE v > 50` | 3.23 M rows/s | 2.41 M rows/s | **0.75×** |

The gain tracks how much of the pipeline stays columnar. Fully-columnar paths lead — the copy
**4.68×**, the windowed aggregate over a columnar source **1.82×**, the event-time interval join
**1.71×** (Flink's interval join is slow; ours delegates the match to a DataFusion hash join). The
**Parquet sink reaches 2.24×** even from a row source: it writes Arrow → Parquet natively and
coalesces batches into size-targeted files
(rolling on a row target / checkpoint) instead of one file per batch, so per-file overhead no longer
scales with batch count — this also lifted the columnar copy (2.61 → 4.68×). Other row-source ops
still pay a `RowData → Arrow` transpose at the input, ~25% cheaper since the converter was made
row-major + pre-sized ([wontdos/28](../.claude/wontdos/28-native-row-transpose-and-shuffle.md)): `OVER`
running `SUM` **1.56×**, tumbling **1.24×**. The lone stateless **filter stays below 1× at 0.75×** —
a single cheap predicate cannot earn back the `RowData → Arrow → RowData` round-trip. A lone operator
crosses 1× once fed by a columnar source or chained with other native operators (no transpose between
them) — the columnar-flow work ([divergences/08](../divergences/08-columnar-flow-transitions.md)).

### How we got these numbers (a profiling lesson)

The first end-to-end numbers were *far* worse — the columnar copy measured **0.45×**, which
made no sense for a zero-transpose pipeline. Rather than tune blindly, we profiled, and the
chain of measurements is worth recording:

1. **Pure-native ceiling**: a Rust-only Parquet copy of 5M rows ran in **0.36s (14 M rows/s)**
   — so native compute was never the bottleneck; the JVM job was ~13× slower than the compute.
2. **Fixed vs. variable**: at 100K rows native and Flink tied (~0.66s, all fixed job overhead);
   the gap only appeared at scale, so it was a per-row/per-batch cost.
3. **Component timing**: the sink's `Native.writeParquet` dominated (**5.8s of 7.3s**), ~17×
   slower per batch than the *same* native write standalone. Export/serialization were
   negligible (the operators chained, so no IPC).
4. **GC ruled out**: a `-verbose:gc` run showed exactly **one** 5.7ms pause — not GC.
5. **Root cause**: the Maven build loaded the **debug** native library (`cargo build`, no
   `--release`). Debug Rust on Parquet byte-encoding is ~10–20× slower. Building release
   (`-Pbench`) moved the copy from **0.45× to 3.19×** — same code.

The lesson is baked into the harness: benchmarks must run under `-Pbench` (release), and
`mvn test` keeps the fast debug build for the correctness loop only.

## Nexmark

The Nexmark suite is the honest end-to-end read: the source is the rowwise `nexmark` datagen (the
wide event row — `event_type` plus nested `person`/`auction`/`bid` structs) and the sink is
`blackhole` (also rowwise), exactly the published Nexmark plan, so a native island pays a
`RowData → Arrow` transpose at the source **and** an `Arrow → RowData` transpose at the sink. We keep
both transposes in the measured path on purpose — a real deployment feeds us rowwise records and
drains to a rowwise sink, so this is the honest number, not the favorable columnar-source/sink case.
Object reuse is on for both engines (a standard tuned-prod setting).

### q0–q4 (rowwise source + blackhole sink)

The first five queries, 2 M events, single slot — `SF_BENCHMARK=true mvn test -Pbench
-Dtest=NexmarkBenchmark`. q1's decimal arithmetic is exact and native by default (Decimal128 multiply
+ a HALF_UP cast to DECIMAL(23,3), matching Flink).

| Query | Shape | Flink | Native | Native vs. Flink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| q2 | filter `WHERE MOD(auction, 123) = 0` | 1.91 M ev/s | 2.87 M ev/s | **1.50×** |
| q1 | `0.908 * price` (exact decimal) | 1.92 M ev/s | 2.15 M ev/s | **1.12×** |
| q0 | pass-through projection of `bid` fields | 2.00 M ev/s | 2.17 M ev/s | **1.08×** |
| q4 | regular join → `MAX` per auction → `AVG` per category | 1.12 M ev/s | 1.15 M ev/s | **1.03×** |
| q3 | regular (updating) join `auction ⋈ person` on seller | 2.93 M ev/s | 1.57 M ev/s | **0.54×** |

**q0/q1/q2 beat stock Flink** even on the rowwise perimeter. Four changes got them there, all profiled
on q0: disabling Arrow's per-accessor bounds/refcount checks (deployment flag); object reuse (drops
Flink's per-handoff defensive copy); a zero-copy `ColumnarRowData` at the exit transpose; and — the big
one — **nested projection pushdown at the entry transpose**, which converts only the columns and struct
sub-fields the calc reads rather than the whole wide row, so unread structs never touch Arrow. That
roughly doubled native throughput and was the difference between ~0.6× and >1×.

**q4 reaches parity** (0.69→1.03×): its join is a *regular* updating join (the `B.dateTime BETWEEN
A.dateTime AND A.expires` bound is a data column, not an interval) feeding two `GROUP BY`s. Batching the
INNER join's whole input (one columnar residual-predicate eval, emit by `filter_record_batch`, rows
moved into state rather than re-cloned) removed the per-pair `ScalarValue` and clone churn. **q3 stays
below 1×**: the same regular join but with *unbounded, ever-growing* state (one popular seller matching
many auctions), and the residue is the per-row state store — a fresh `OwnedRow` per buffered row where
Flink reuses pooled `BinaryRowData`. A free-list allocator for the keyed-multiset buffers is the next
lever ([divergences/08](../divergences/08-columnar-flow-transitions.md)).

### q0–q2 from a Kafka source (native decode)

The native decoder is itself a (Rust) bytes→Arrow transpose. Flink does **not** push projection into
the Kafka scan, so its format decodes the whole record; we push the query's projection into the decode
so it builds only the read columns/fields. `SF_BENCHMARK=true mvn test -Pbench
-Dtest=NexmarkKafkaBenchmark` (Testcontainers Kafka). 2 M events, native decode vs Flink's own format:

| Query | JSON (Flink → Native) | Avro (Flink → Native) | Protobuf (Flink → Native) |
|---|---|---|---|
| q0 pass-through | 0.67 → 0.86 M ev/s — **1.27×** | 0.81 → 1.33 M ev/s — **1.64×** | 1.15 → 1.45 M ev/s — **1.26×** |
| q1 currency | 0.77 → 0.85 M ev/s — **1.10×** | 0.82 → 1.34 M ev/s — **1.63×** | 1.14 → 1.49 M ev/s — **1.30×** |
| q2 filter | 0.80 → 0.93 M ev/s — **1.17×** | 0.83 → 1.52 M ev/s — **1.83×** | 1.17 → 1.60 M ev/s — **1.36×** |

**Every format now clears 1× (JSON 1.1–1.3×, Avro 1.6–1.8×, Protobuf 1.3×) — each after attacking
what its profile said it was bound by.** All formats share a large Kafka-I/O + thread-sync cost
(~38–45%) with the Flink run; the decode itself is bound by different work. **JSON was
tokenize-bound** (~19% of CPU in `arrow-json`'s scalar tape parse of the whole document, only ~5%
building the Arrow arrays — so projection pruning couldn't help, and Flink's mature deserializer held
it to ~parity, 0.97–1.02×); swapping the tokenizer for a **simd-json** SIMD parse walked straight
into Arrow builders ([divergences/18](../divergences/18-simd-json-decode.md)) lifted it to
1.10–1.27×. **Avro is build/copy-bound** (~27% `memmove` + ~15% decode, of which `append_null` for
the mostly-null `person`/`auction` union branches was ~15% alone — pushing the projection into the
decode removed that build/copy of unread fields). **Protobuf** is also build/copy-bound (~25%
`memmove` + ~16% ptars decode); pruning via a **pruned descriptor** (ptars builds a column per
descriptor field and skips wire tags it has no field for) flipped it from 0.88–0.94× to 1.26–1.36×.

### The row→columnar ladder (Kafka)

How far into Rust the source-side work moves, on the same q0/q1/q2 over the same produced bytes, all vs
stock Flink. Three rungs, each one layer more native (projection pushed in at every rung that can):

1. **JVM transpose** — Flink consumes *and* decodes to `RowData` with its own format, then a JVM
   `RowData → Arrow` transpose feeds the native calc.
2. **Rust transpose, JVM poll** — Flink's `KafkaSource` polls raw bytes, a native operator decodes them
   straight to Arrow (the shallow decode path).
3. **Rust poll + Rust transpose** — the native rdkafka source: Rust owns the consume *and* the decode.
   No Flink Kafka client, no `RowData`.

`SF_BENCHMARK=true mvn test -Pbench -Dnative.cargo.args="build --release --features mimalloc"
-Dtest=NexmarkKafkaLadderBenchmark`. 2 M events, ×vs stock Flink (best rung **bold**; the
`mimalloc` feature — the recommended Kafka build — link-aliases the library's allocator, worth
+12–22% on the source rung, divergences/19):

| Format | Flink (ev/s) | JVM transpose | Rust transpose, JVM poll | Rust poll + Rust transpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| JSON q0 | 0.77 M | 1.05× | 1.20× | **2.25×** |
| JSON q1 | 0.79 M | 1.05× | 1.18× | **2.26×** |
| JSON q2 | 0.83 M | 1.07× | 1.20× | **2.20×** |
| Avro q0 | 0.88 M | 0.99× | 1.64× | **3.03×** |
| Avro q1 | 0.87 M | 0.97× | 1.61× | **2.99×** |
| Avro q2 | 0.83 M | 1.10× | 1.82× | **3.38×** |
| Protobuf q0 | 1.23 M | 1.06× | 1.27× | **2.29×** |
| Protobuf q1 | 1.19 M | 1.03× | 1.29× | **2.36×** |
| Protobuf q2 | 1.21 M | 1.18× | 1.38× | **2.34×** |

**The full native source is the best rung on every format — 2.2–3.4× stock Flink** and 1.7–1.9×
the shallow decode rung. An earlier version of this table had the source rung *trailing* the
shallow rung on Avro/Protobuf, capped at a ~1.35 M ev/s ceiling; the consume fast path
(divergences/19 — one-lock callback drain, inline decode instead of a decode thread, metadata
warm-up before assign, the `check.crcs` default, and the `mimalloc` allocator rebind) removed
that ceiling, and the source rung now runs 1.7–2.8 M ev/s end to end.

**Reference — the transpose floor (no Kafka).** The same q0/q1/q2 with the source replaced by the
in-process `nexmark` datagen emitting `RowData` directly — no Kafka client, no format decode, just the
columnar island over a free source and `blackhole` sink (`-Dtest=NexmarkBenchmark`). The ceiling for
what columnar execution buys when I/O and decode are free:

| Query | Flink (RowData) | Native (JVM transpose, no decode) | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| q0 pass-through | 1.93 M ev/s | 2.11 M ev/s | **1.09×** |
| q1 currency | 1.76 M ev/s | 1.97 M ev/s | **1.12×** |
| q2 filter | 1.75 M ev/s | 2.84 M ev/s | **1.62×** |

Both engines run 2–3× faster in absolute ev/s than any Kafka rung — that gap is exactly the Kafka
consume + decode the ladder is about. The native speedup is pure columnar execution: modest on the
projections (transpose-bound) and large on the filter (native discards rows in Arrow before they are
ever materialized to `RowData`).

### The full accelerating set, every source

`NexmarkMatrixBenchmark` runs **every query StreamFusion accelerates** (q0–q5, q7–q23 — only q6 is out;
see [.claude/wontdos/39-nexmark-q6-exclusion.md](../.claude/wontdos/39-nexmark-q6-exclusion.md)) over **every
source it can be fed by** — the rowwise generator, a local Parquet file, and Kafka json/avro/protobuf
across the ladder — all vs stock Flink, same steelmanned perimeter. 500K events.

`SF_BENCHMARK=true mvn test -Pbench -Dnative.cargo.args="build --release --features mimalloc"
-Dtest=NexmarkMatrixBenchmark` (Testcontainers Kafka; the `kafka` feature is a build default, and
`mimalloc` — the recommended build — rebinds the library's allocator, divergences/19). Column
toggles: `SF_MATRIX_GENERATOR` / `SF_MATRIX_PARQUET` / `SF_MATRIX_KAFKA` (`false` skips one), plus
`SF_MATRIX_FLUSS` (`true` *adds* the opt-in Fluss rung — off by default; see below).

The matrix runs with the native managed-memory cap **in force**: the shared test cluster declares a
deployment-like managed-memory size (flink-test-utils' default gave each slot ~10 MB, which the
accounted updating joins outgrow at 500K events; a real TaskManager's 40%-of-process managed memory
holds that state easily, so the benchmark cluster is sized to match). Reserving managed memory is
bookkeeping, not allocation — the budget costs nothing until state actually grows into it.

All the stateful operators run **columnar on Arrow byte-state**: Top-N, keep-last dedup, the updating
join, and the group/`DISTINCT` and windowed (tumbling/hopping/cumulative/session) aggregates key and
buffer their state as memcomparable arrow-row bytes (à la RisingWave's value-encoded state + Arroyo's
`RowConverter`), not boxed `Vec<ScalarValue>`.

_Numbers are one **combined run** (2026-07-05) — every query in a single JVM, best of 2 after a
warmup, 500K events.
A combined run accumulates heap/GC pressure that disproportionately slows the alloc-heavier native side,
so these **understate** native for the aggregate/dedup queries; it is the conservative read._

**Generator** (the transpose floor — no I/O, no decode), native vs Flink, sorted by speedup (q21 appears
twice — the byte-parity default and the opt-in native regex/case path, see † below):

| Query | Shape | Native vs. Flink |
|---|---|---|
| q11 | session-window `COUNT` per bidder | **2.79×** |
| q7 | tumble `MAX` ⋈ bid | **1.61×** |
| q12 | proctime tumble `COUNT` per bidder | **1.52×** |
| q19 | `ROW_NUMBER` topN (≤ 10) | **1.50×** |
| q5 | Hot Items (window re-agg + window join) | **1.47×** |

**Parquet file** — the columnar-source case: the native island reads Arrow straight from the
`filesystem`/`parquet` scan, so there is no `RowData → Arrow` transpose at ingest (only the sink
transpose remains). Same queries, sorted by speedup:

| Query | Native vs. Flink | | Query | Native vs. Flink |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| q11 | **5.39×** | | q12 | **3.23×** |
| q8 | **4.37×** | | q0 | **3.21×** |
| q7 | **4.22×** | | q1 | **3.07×** |
| q23 | **3.91×** | | q10 | **2.54×** |
| q4 | **3.61×** | | q18 | **2.27×** |
| q22 | **3.58×** | | q13 | **2.26×** |

| q2 | **3.56×** | | q15 | **2.07×** |
| q5 | **3.45×** | | q9 | **1.94×** |
| q20 | **3.40×** | | q19 | **1.75×** |
| q14 | **3.30×** | | q16 | **1.37×** |
| q21 | **2.77×** (6.14× native regex/case) | | | |

Every query clears 1× — most **2–5.4×**, the floor q16 at 1.37× — because the ingest transpose is
gone: the scan feeds Arrow batches directly into the operator, and only the `blackhole` sink pays a
transpose. The queries that are transpose-bound on the generator (q8 at 0.87×, q3 at 0.95×, q20 at
0.84×) are exactly the ones that jump the most here (q8 4.37×, q3 3.57×, q20 3.40×) — confirming their
generator cost was the `RowData` perimeter, not the operator. Parquet's rowtime is a plain
`TIMESTAMP(3)`, so the `DATE_FORMAT`/`HOUR` queries (q10/q14/q15/q16/q17) run natively (over the Kafka
`TIMESTAMP_LTZ` they run natively too now — see the Kafka table's `§` note). q16 — long the one Parquet
query below 1× (its multi-`DISTINCT` accumulator churned `ScalarValue`) — cleared it when the
`mimalloc` build rebound the library's allocator, and again moved (1.10→1.34) when the DISTINCT sets
went typed and the state probes went borrowed-byte.

**Nineteen clear 1.0× even on this conservative combined run** (sixteen before the 2026-07 profiling
round, eighteen after its first pass — the differential flame-graph work recorded in
`.claude/research/nexmark-operator-profiles-2026-07.md`, whose shipped levers are itemized in
`docs/optimizations.md`: shared rowwise prefix under scoped sub-plan reuse, allocation-free state
probes across the join/aggregate/dedup/Top-N maps, typed DISTINCT sets + cached changelog emit,
decode-deduplicated Top-N emit, the transpose string single-copy, the lookup join's collect-time
Arrow writes, and the byte-path parity upcalls). The round's second pass measured its movers on the
75-second profile loop: **q21's parity path +12%** (the byte marshalling + primitive ASCII fold),
**q23 +8.5%**, **q18 +5.4%**, **q16 +3.4%**. The
window-aggregate queries moved earlier when the aggregators went to arrow-row keys and the session
update went run-batched (**q5 1.00→1.47, q8 0.70→0.87, q11 2.41→2.79** cumulatively). The
**updating-join family was the earlier big mover**: a CPU profile put ~40% of the worst query (q9)
in the joiner. Making the INNER join batch its whole input — gather all candidate pairs against the
fixed probe side, evaluate the residual predicate once columnar, emit by `filter_record_batch`, and
move rows into state instead of re-cloning — lifted **q9 0.39→0.97, q4 0.64→1.07, q7 0.91→1.37,
q23 0.66→0.96** at the time. The lever throughout was a differential profile's clearest signal — on
every changelog operator native spent 10–22% of CPU in the system allocator where Flink spends ~1%
(Flink reuses pooled `BinaryRowData`, its cost landing in GC). Cutting those allocations, not
swapping the allocator, closed the gap
([divergences/08](../divergences/08-columnar-flow-transitions.md)).

What still trails 1× on this rung: q8 is transpose-bound (a window join with only a ~9% native
island); q20 is the widest updating join (its state probes are allocation-free and its stored-row
decode no longer registers on the profile — the remainder is intrinsic hash-join work over the
rowwise perimeter, see wontdos/48); and q3 (0.95×) and q21's byte-parity upcall (0.96×) sit at the
line. q14 crossed it this run (1.02×); q13's lookup join,
long below 1×, cleared it when its collector started writing straight into the Arrow builders.

**† q21 is reported on both paths.** By default its `REGEXP_EXTRACT` and `LOWER` run through a
byte-identical **JVM upcall** (one JNI crossing per batch): the compile cost
is cached, the string boundary stays in UTF-8 bytes with a primitive ASCII fold, and the argument
columns marshal once per batch (0.75× → 0.86× → ~parity across the round; this combined run reads
0.96×, and the isolated 75s profile loop puts it above 1× — the upcall path is the most sensitive
to the combined run's accumulated GC pressure). The price of staying
exactly Flink-equal on functions whose Rust regex / case-folding can diverge at a locale/regex edge
is ~1.6× against the opt-in: `-Dstreamfusion.expression.allowIncompatible=true` runs the
**pure-native Rust** path at **1.54×**. Both are documented in
[divergences/07](../divergences/07-expression-encoding-and-compile-once.md).

**‡ q1's approximate-decimal toggle buys nothing.** The exact `Decimal128` multiply (byte-parity) is not
the bottleneck, so the approximate `double` path measures within noise of it (occasionally slower in a
combined run) — exact-by-default costs nothing and the non-parity toggle isn't worth enabling. Reported
as a single row.

**§ `DATE_FORMAT`/`HOUR` over the Kafka `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` now runs natively** (q10/q14/q15/q16/q17 — these
were skipped here before). The default routes the LTZ case through Flink's own zone-aware datetime code
via a JVM upcall (byte-parity); a pure-Rust `chrono-tz` path is opt-in under `allowIncompatible` but
measures within noise (the datetime call isn't the bottleneck), so parity is free — see
[divergences/17](../divergences/17-ltz-datetime-session-zone.md). Reported as a single row.

**Kafka**, the full native rdkafka source rung — after the consume fast path (divergences/19) it is
the best rung on **every row**, so the table reports it directly (native speedup vs that format's own

**Every Kafka row clears 1.65×, all but a handful clear 2×, and the peak is q11 at 3.9–5.6×.**
These numbers include the source's per-partition watermark regeneration (the matrix tables declare a
`WATERMARK`, pushed into the scan): windows fire incrementally mid-stream exactly as on stock Flink,
and the per-batch max-rowtime scan that feeds it costs nothing measurable. The same watermark work
collapses the two middle rungs on these tables — the decode rung declines a watermarked table (it
cannot regenerate the pushed watermark), so its per-rung numbers now equal the JVM-transpose rung's;
the un-watermarked ladder tables above are unaffected. An
earlier version of this table reported "best rung per format", because the source rung was capped by
a per-poll ceiling and the shallow decode (or even the JVM transpose) rung often led; the consume
fast path removed that ceiling and made the source rung strictly dominant — including for the
changelog-heavy queries (q9/q19) that previously gained nothing from faster decode, and
q3/q14/q18/q21, whose JSON rows were below 1× on their old best rung and now sit at ~2×+. The floor
of the table is q16 and the changelog-bound q3/q19 — operator-bound queries where the consume saving
is diluted, not reversed.

**Fluss** — the opt-in fourth source rung (`SF_MATRIX_FLUSS=true`), the columnar-on-the-wire
source: the same wide event row is preloaded into a local Fluss test cluster and read back by
both engines in the identical default streaming runtime — stock Flink-on-Fluss vs the native
fluss-rs log-table reader. Boundedness comes from a count-N-then-cancel collecting sink, so each
cell measures time-to-Nth-row at `SF_ROWS` scale. The native reader requires the `fluss` cargo
feature in the build, added alongside the recommended `mimalloc`: `SF_BENCHMARK=true
SF_MATRIX_FLUSS=true mvn test -Pbench -Dnative.cargo.args="build --release --features
mimalloc,fluss" -Dtest=NexmarkMatrixBenchmark`. Building the `fluss` feature currently needs
`protoc` (`protobuf-compiler`) because fluss-rs generates its RPC protos at build time.

Because the log table is unbounded, the rung needs a deterministic Nth sink row to cancel at.
The benchmark table declares the generator's own 4s bounded-out-of-orderness `WATERMARK` (the
Fluss catalog persists it), so the windowed event-time queries run on both engines — Flink keeps
the watermark as an assigner node above the Fluss scan (no push-down, unlike Kafka), and that
assigner runs natively above the native source. A preloaded sentinel event (an `event_type`
outside 0..2 with a far-future rowtime, invisible to every view) advances the watermark past
every real window end, closing the same windows the bounded generator calibration's end-of-input
flush closes, so the counts line up. Three queries have no usable row count and use a **poison
marker** finish line instead: a traced copy of the preload appends one poison auction+bid pair
(ids outside every real range; the bid's channel is `apple`) after all real events, and the run
cancels when the pair's output row reaches the sink — in a parallelism-1 pipeline that row is
necessarily emitted after every real row, so time-to-marker measures the same full drain,
without a count:

- **q4/q9** — their two-input join feeds an update-collapsing aggregate/rank: Flink skips the
  `-U/+U` pair when an input row doesn't change the aggregate value, so the changelog row *count*
  depends on the join's input interleaving — non-deterministic even between two stock Flink runs
  (a 500K run calibrated 362,710 rows off the generator and observed 316,092 on Fluss, the job
  idle). Values and final state are identical; only the update cadence varies. The marker (q4:
  the poison category's aggregate row; q9: the poison auction's rank row) sidesteps the count
  entirely.
- **q21** — emits zero rows over this generator's data (its channels are `channel-N` and its
  URLs carry no `channel_id=`), so the poison bid's `apple` channel makes the marker row its
  first and only output.

One query skips: **q12** — a proctime window's output count is wall-clock-dependent, and any
marker's own window would close ~10s (the window size) after the drain, so a finish line would
time the window, not the engines. It stays measured on the bounded rungs, whose end-of-input
flush fires proctime windows immediately. Upstreaming `scan.bounded.mode` to Fluss
(`.claude/todos/54-fluss-bounded-scan-upstream.md`) would retire the count, sentinel, and
marker machinery at once and admit q12.

Run of 2026-07-06 (500K events, best of 2 after a warmup, time-to-Nth-row, native vs the stock

**The zero-transpose hypothesis holds where the pipeline is source-bound.** The wire format is
Arrow, so the native reader feeds the island directly — no ingest transpose, no decode — and
the stateless queries hit the highest absolute native rates of any streaming rung (q2 at 4.7 M
ev/s; the generator rung's q2 runs ~2.8 M). The updating joins are the clearest confirmation:
q3 and q20, *below 1×* on the `RowData` generator (0.95×/0.84×) because their cost was the
perimeter transpose, run 2.27× and 2.31× here — the same jump the Parquet rung showed. The
windowed family runs natively end to end off the table's watermark, q11's session windows
peaking at **4.17×** — the rung's best cell.

**The distinct-agg family (q15/q16/q17) trails 1× on this rung only** (0.78–0.85×, vs
1.3–1.4× on the generator and 2.1–3.1× on Kafka), with q19 at the line (0.97×). The salient
difference is batch shape: the fluss-rs scanner emits one Arrow batch per producer wire batch,
so the island sees a stream of small batches, and the changelog-aggregate chain
(exchange → multi-`DISTINCT` group agg) pays its per-batch costs — state probe setup, per-batch
emit — many more times per 500K events than on the coalesced rungs. This is the batch-coalescing
follow-up already on the roadmap (coalesce scanner batches to a target row count before JNI
export), and these queries are its acceptance benchmark.

The opt-in variants measure within noise of their byte-parity defaults on this rung — except
**† q21**, whose work is regex-dominated: the byte-parity JVM-upcall default reads **2.28×** and
the opt-in pure-Rust regex/case path **5.25×**, the honest cost of the parity guarantee on a
full-drain measurement (the same split the Parquet rung shows at 2.77× vs 6.14×). q4/q9/q21 are
the marker-measured cells (run 2026-07-06, same build).

**Two masked native bugs surfaced the first time this rung ran unbounded** — worth recording
because every earlier rung was bounded, where the end-of-input `MAX_WATERMARK` flush forgives
mid-stream watermark mistakes:

1. **A missing sub-plan-reuse barrier on the Fluss scan.** Every native rel carries a digest
   barrier so Flink's post-optimize reuse can never merge two branches onto one columnar
   producer (the Arrow hand-off is zero-copy, single-consumer); the Fluss source node lacked
   one, so multi-view queries merged into one source broadcasting the same batch to two
   consumers — a use-after-free the watermark assigner turned into a hard crash.
2. **A shift-zone asymmetry in the window re-aggregation path (q5's shape).** Flink's rule:
   plain-`TIMESTAMP` rowtime windows compute on epoch millis with UTC digits; only
   `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` shifts boundaries into the session zone. The local window aggregate's exec
   node passed the session zone unconditionally, and its window-attached ingest (the only
   consumer of that zone) "un-shifted" boundaries that were never shifted — every re-aggregated
   window landed the session-zone offset in the future, where only a bounded run's final flush
   ever released it. Both engines' results were still identical on the bounded rungs, which is
   why parity never caught it; the unbounded rung is the first consumer of mid-stream firing
   for that shape.

### The tuned (mini-batch) matrix — the full suite

Production Flink deployments routinely enable mini-batch for stateful queries, so the matrix has a
**tuned mode**: `table.exec.mini-batch.*` (2s allow-latency, size 50000) on **both** engines — the
steelman rule, and the config behind the only public per-query Alibaba comparison. Generator source
(the tuned question is engine-vs-engine, not the perimeter) and **5M events** so the flush cadence
amortizes (at 500K the run is shorter than one flush interval and measures latency artifacts).
`table.optimizer.distinct-agg.split.enabled` stays default-off: it
is a skew mitigation for parallel deployments (these runs are parallelism 1) and its incremental
plan chain deliberately has no native path (`wontdos/52-distinct-split-chain.md`).
`SF_BENCHMARK=true SF_MATRIX_TUNED=true SF_ROWS=5000000
SF_MATRIX_QUERIES=q0,…,q23 mvn test -Pbench -Dnative.cargo.args="build --release --features
mimalloc" -Dtest=NexmarkMatrixBenchmark#tunedMiniBatchMatrix` (the query list defaults to the
changelog family — mini-batch changes only those plans — but the full-suite run below doubles as
the coverage check that **every** query still routes native under production tuning; run
2026-07-05, no fallbacks).

| Query | Shape | Native vs. tuned Flink |
|---|---|---|
| q0 | pass-through projection of `bid` | **1.23×** |
| q1 | `0.908 * price` — exact `Decimal128` (byte-parity) | **1.16×** |

| q12 | proctime tumble `COUNT` per bidder | **1.70×** |
| q13 | lookup join (bounded dimension) | **1.09×** |
| q14 | `HOUR`/`CASE` + `count_char` UDF + decimal | **1.05×** |
| q15 | multi-`DISTINCT` `COUNT`s per day (`DATE_FORMAT` group) | **1.26×** |
| q16 | multi-`DISTINCT` per channel/day | **1.18×** |
| q17 | group agg + `AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`SUM` per day | 1.00× |
| q18 | `ROW_NUMBER` dedup (≤ 1) | **2.02×** |
| q19 | `ROW_NUMBER` topN (≤ 10) | **2.36×** |
| q20 | updating join (`category = 10`) | **1.34×** |
| q21 | `CASE` + `REGEXP_EXTRACT`/`LOWER` — JVM upcall (byte-parity) | 0.97× |
| q22 | `SPLIT_INDEX(url, '/', n)` projection | **1.25×** |
| q23 | three-way join `bid ⋈ person ⋈ auction` | **3.01×** |

The changelog-family margins are **wider** than the default-config generator column, not narrower:
at 5M events the state-heavy queries dominate their runtime with operator work (the per-event
JIT/setup share shrinks), and under mini-batch the native side emits the net per-batch Top-N diff
(divergences/20) where Flink's rank — which has no mini-batch variant — still pays the per-record
cascade (q19 2.36× tuned vs 1.48× default). The non-changelog queries plan identically tuned or
not (mini-batch inserts nothing into them), so their column is effectively the generator rung at
5M events — the same transpose-bound stragglers trail here for the same reason (q3 a thin island
over a wide transposed perimeter, q8's window join, q21's per-batch JVM upcall at 5M-event scale);
the mini-batch config itself costs the native side nothing since calc pruning pushes through the
assigner.

The first tuned run reported q4/q15/q16/q17 as fallbacks — the tuned column doubling as the
mini-batch coverage check, exactly as designed. That coverage has since landed (two-phase FILTER
clauses, filtered distinct views, string MIN/MAX partials, retraction-bearing partials with the
count1 record counter), and all four now run fully native — as does the whole suite, including
the windowed two-phase splits over every value type (the 2026-07-05 nullable-sum-buffer work).
q15/q16 are worth noting: `GROUP BY
day` is a single live grouping key carrying every record's bidder/auction distinct sets — the
hot-key shape `distinct-agg.split` exists to mitigate — and the native no-split plan beats tuned
Flink on it (see `wontdos/52-distinct-split-chain.md`).
