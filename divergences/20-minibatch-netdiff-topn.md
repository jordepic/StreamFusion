# Mini-batch Top-N emits the net per-batch rank diff, not the per-record cascade

When the host plan runs mini-batch (`table.exec.mini-batch.enabled`), the native append-only Top-N
folds each input batch into its buffers first and then emits one net diff per touched partition —
the old top-N versus the new (rank-by-rank `-U`/`+U` with the rank projected; membership `-D`/`+I`
without) — instead of Flink's `AppendOnlyTopNFunction` contract of an UPDATE_BEFORE/UPDATE_AFTER
pair for every shifted rank of every input record. With mini-batch off, nothing changes: the
cascade is emitted per record, byte-identical to the host (the default byte-parity mode).

## Why this is the right gate

Flink's rank operators have no mini-batch variant, so strictly speaking mini-batch Flink still
emits the per-record cascade. But the parity contract of a mini-batch plan is already the
**collapsed** changelog, not the raw byte sequence: Flink's own bundled operators (group
aggregate, dedup) collapse a bundle's intermediates into one event per key per flush, on
proc-time-driven boundaries that are not deterministic even across two runs of the same Flink job.
Our parity harness therefore compares mini-batch plans by their collapsed changelog
(`assertChangelogParity`), and the net diff preserves that exactly — every materialized state the
downstream can observe is identical; only intermediate retractions within one Arrow batch are
elided, precisely the class of difference mini-batch itself introduces.

The practical stake is q19's shape: the cascade's emitted volume is roughly the per-partition
input multiplicity per batch, and after the decode-dedup optimization the operator is bound by
materializing that amplified output. The net diff cuts the emitted volume to the actual rank
changes.

## What a raw-changelog consumer sees

A sink that consumes the raw changelog (Kafka debezium/canal) observes fewer intermediate
retractions than stock Flink would emit — the same caveat that applies to enabling mini-batch on
Flink itself for the aggregate operators. An upsert or materializing consumer sees no difference.
A Top-N whose input is append-only and whose plan is otherwise unaffected by mini-batch (e.g. a
pure `ROW_NUMBER() <= N` over a source) does have a deterministic stock-Flink cascade; enabling
mini-batch opts that query into the collapsed contract too. Users who want the exact per-record
cascade run without mini-batch — the default.

The retracting (changelog-input) ranker already emits a per-input-row diff and is unaffected.
