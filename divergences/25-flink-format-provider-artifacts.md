# 25 — Flink-style format artifacts over a private cross-DSO ABI

## Reference pattern

Flink distributes connector and format implementations as separate JARs. The table runtime discovers
them through `META-INF/services/org.apache.flink.table.factories.Factory`, so a job installs only the
connector and serialization formats it uses.

## StreamFusion decision

StreamFusion follows that deployment shape for native value decoding. `streamfusion-kafka` owns Kafka
consumption and emits Arrow batches containing raw Kafka value bodies. `streamfusion-json`,
`streamfusion-csv`, `streamfusion-raw`, `streamfusion-avro`,
`streamfusion-avro-confluent-registry`, and `streamfusion-protobuf` register
`NativeFormatProvider` implementations through Java `ServiceLoader`. The planner selects a provider
only when its artifact and supported options are present; otherwise it leaves the table on stock Flink.

## Why not let Kafka call every format directly?

An earlier native Kafka source owned the message decoder. That made its DSO link Kafka plus every
format dependency and made the base deployment unable to follow Flink's optional-format convention.
Passing a Rust decoder handle from the Kafka DSO to a format DSO would exchange Rust-owned objects and
allocator state across dynamic-library boundaries, which is not a stable ABI.

Arrow's C Data Interface is already the ownership-safe JNI boundary in this project. The Kafka DSO
exports a body batch to Java and the format DSO imports that batch through the same interface; each
handle remains private to its creator. This adds a DSO boundary at source ingest, but keeps the format
installable, testable, and fallback-safe. A future fused ABI is acceptable only after benchmarks show
the boundary is material and it can preserve these ownership rules.

Kafka source watermark regeneration is intentionally not carried over: format decoding now happens
after the source, so computing a rowtime maximum inside the connector would re-couple it to formats.
Watermarked Kafka tables therefore fall back to Flink until an Arrow-level, per-split watermark
contract is designed and parity-tested.
