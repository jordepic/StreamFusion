# StreamFusion

Run Apache Flink SQL faster by executing supported operators natively (Rust + Apache
Arrow/DataFusion over JNI) while Flink continues to own planning, coordination, and
everything not yet supported. Substitution is transparent and conservative: a query is
planned by Flink, the operators we can reproduce exactly are swapped for native ones, and
anything else falls back to Flink with identical results.

## Compatibility Chart

What executes natively today and the conditions under which each operator is accelerated.
An operator is substituted only when **all** of its terms (plus the global terms) hold;
otherwise it runs on Flink unchanged.

| Operator | Accelerated | Terms |
|---|---|---|
| Projection | Demo only | Single integer input column; the projection is exactly `col * 2`. (A proof of the projection path, not a general projection yet.) |
| Tumbling window aggregate | Yes | Event-time `TUMBLE` over a local-time-zone (rowtime) attribute; one or more aggregates over the same value column — `SUM` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `COUNT` (and `AVG` only as a lone aggregate); grouped by the window, optionally plus one or more bigint/int keys. Value-type support is the parity intersection in [docs/aggregate-type-support.md](docs/aggregate-type-support.md): all five over bigint/double, and `SUM`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`COUNT` over int (`SUM` keeps the host's wrapping int semantics). `AVG` follows Flink's integer-division semantics and so stays bigint-only; double values are one-phase only. |
| Hopping window aggregate | Yes | Same as tumbling, with `HOP`. One-phase assigns each row to its overlapping windows; two-phase (the default plan) pre-aggregates per slice and combines the shared slices of each window, requiring the slide to divide the size (other ratios fall back). |
| Session window aggregate | Yes | Same aggregate/key/value terms as tumbling, with `SESSION` (optionally `PARTITION BY` one or more bigint keys). Each element opens a gap-wide window; overlapping or touching windows merge, including when a late element bridges two open sessions. Always single-phase (the host never splits sessions), so no `ONE_PHASE` is needed. |
| Cumulative window aggregate | One-phase only | Same terms as tumbling, with `CUMULATE` (zero offset only). Nested windows share a bucket start and grow by the step up to the max size. Like `HOP`, two-phase slice-sharing is not native, so set `table.optimizer.agg-phase-strategy = ONE_PHASE`. |

Two-phase (local + global) aggregation is accelerated too: the native local
pre-aggregate emits partial state, the host shuffles by key, and the native
global merges — for `SUM`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`COUNT` (not `AVG`, whose partial is
multi-field). This is the default planning, so tumbling and hopping window
aggregation no longer need `ONE_PHASE`. Hopping uses the host's slice-sharing
model (a per-slice local, a global that combines each window's slices).

### Global terms (all native execution)

- **Insert-only streams.** Retracting or updating (changelog) streams fall back to Flink.

### Not yet accelerated (falls back to Flink)

- SQL filters (a native filter exists but is not yet wired into planning)
- Two-phase (slice-sharing) cumulative windows, and two-phase hopping where the slide does not divide the size
- Grouping keys that are neither bigint nor int (e.g. string), aggregates over different value columns, or `COUNT(*)`
- `AVG` over int, and any aggregate over smallint/tinyint/float/decimal — see [docs/aggregate-type-support.md](docs/aggregate-type-support.md)
- Two-phase (local + global) aggregation over a double value column
- Two-phase `AVG` (multi-field partial state)

## Related work

Two commercial native Flink accelerators exist, both **closed source**:

- **Iron Vector** (Irontools) — the same stack as us: Rust + Arrow + DataFusion
  over zero-copy JNI, transparent fallback. It serializes the plan to the native
  side with [Substrait](https://substrait.io/) and integrates at the
  StreamTask/subtopology level, exchanging Arrow batches over Flink's network
  rather than `RowData`. Today it is **stateless only** (projections, filters,
  expressions); windows, joins, stateful operators, and exactly-once are
  described as planned. It claims ~97% higher throughput on a stateless ETL
  pipeline.
  ([blog](https://irontools.dev/blog/introducing-iron-vector/))
- **Vera X** (Ververica, the original Flink creators) — a proprietary native
  vectorized engine with a drop-in compatibility layer and a new state store.
  It supports stateful workloads and claims 5–10× on Nexmark SQL and ~52% lower
  resource usage. The implementation (language, columnar library, plan format) is
  undisclosed.
  ([blog](https://www.ververica.com/blog/vera-x-introducing-the-first-native-vectorized-apache-flink-engine))

Where StreamFusion differs: it is **open source**, and every substitution is
gated and verified for identical results against stock Flink by a parity harness
rather than asserted. It is already native on **stateful windowing** — tumbling,
hopping, session, and cumulative windows, one- and two-phase — which Iron Vector
(stateless only) has not yet shipped. It is earlier-stage than Vera X and does not
match its operator breadth or have published benchmarks, but its acceleration is
auditable and parity-first by construction.
